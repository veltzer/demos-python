"""
This is an example of a shared closure. The three functions here share the x
variable.

- note that in this example the closure is just one element "x" which is
the parameter of the function "make_mul_add_print"
- this means that we cannot change it. Why? because it is a primitive.
If we try to change it in another function that we add,say f_set,
then the statement "x=..." will be taken by python to mean the declaration
of another *** local *** variable "x".
