"""
Examples of constructors in python.
You must accept at least one argument in a constructor in order for it
to count as a constructor. You can also write a "varargs" constructor.
Errors for not having the right method occur at runtime and not at
compile time. Because python does not have overloading then if you
do decide to write an __init__ method you have to write it well in
order to avoid a runtime error.

Note that in python2.7 you should have inherited from "object"
this is no longer required in python3.

strictly speaking __init__ in python is not a constructor
but an initializer since __init__ receives "self" which is already
an object of the required type.

If you dont write an explicit "__init__" initializer for your
class then your class still works. It"s just that its empty.
