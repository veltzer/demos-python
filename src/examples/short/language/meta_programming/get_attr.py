"""
This is an example of overloading the __getattr__ python method. This allows
one to pretend to have various attributes or to decide that attributes
come in and out of scope at runtime. Uses for this could include:
- testing and simulation of errors.
- Aspect Oriented Programming.
- Proxy implementations.
- ORM solutions.
- Backwards compatibility solutions.
And more...
