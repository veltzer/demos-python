# RPN Calculator

A "Reverse Polish Notation" calculator takes input in a strange form,
where operators come after the operands::

```text
2 2 + 5 *
```

which means (2 + 2) * 5. There is an extremely simple way to compute
RPN expressions, using a stack:

* When you see a number, push it onto the stack.

* When you see an operator, pop 2 operands from the stack, and push the result on the stack.

Write a program that does this, printing the stack after each word::

```text
[]
2
[2.0]
2
[2.0, 2.0]
+
[4.0]
5
[4.0, 5.0]
*
[20.0]
```

## Hints

* A list works great to represent a stack - use `.append(value)` and `.pop()` methods.
