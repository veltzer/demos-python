# Threading Stack

Write a synchronized (thread safe) stack.
The API:

```python
Push(self,x)
Pop(self)
```

Any thread could push or pop from the stack.
* in the first variant a pop from an empty stack simply returns.
* in the second variant a pop from an empty stack sleeps until data is available.

Write a script that will run 3 producer threads, which will put numbers up to 20 in the stack, and 3 consumer threads which will pop letters from the stack.
